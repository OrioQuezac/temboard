# First connection

Once `temboard` is up and running, it's time to try a first connection to the
web interface with a web browser using `https` at the address
`https://<temboard-host>:8888/`.

![Login](sc/login.png)

You should get a login box. The default administration account is `admin`, the
password is `admin`. Obviously, this password **MUST** be changed as soon as
possible. To edit user's profile, please login and go to `Settings` -> `User
list` then `Edit` on the corresponding row.

![Edit admin user](sc/edit-user-admin.png)

Currently, when a logged in user changes its password, the error message
`Restricted area...` is raised, this behaviour is due to the expiration of user
session when the password has been changed. Go back to the login page and fill
the form with the new password.


# Managing instances

You must be logged in with a user having administration privileges.

## Add a new instance

For each instance you want to manage, [install and configure one agent](agent_install.md).
To register the instance graphically,
go to `Manage` -> `Instances`, then `Add a new instance`.

![Discover instance](sc/discover-instance.png)

You must fill temBoard agent address and port.
Don't confuse with PostgreSQL server address and port.
temBoard will contact the agent and present you informations to identifiy the monitored instance.

![Add instance](sc/add-instance.png)

You can now configure Environment and features enabled for this instance.
Each instance must be in one Environment.
Environment determines which users will have access to the instance.

# Manage users

Once you have an Environment and an instance registered,
share management access to someone by creating a user.

## Add a new user

Go to `Settings` -> `Users`, then `New user`.
You must define the password.
Only administrators can change password.

![Add user](sc/add-user.png)

Once user is created, allow him to access to the instance by adding him to the Environment.
Go to `Settings` -> `Environments`,
then click the :fontawesome-solid-users: icon on the corresponding row.
Click `Add member` in this page and search for *alice*.
Click on username to allow him to the Environment.

![Add member](sc/add-member.png)

Once a user has access to an environment,
he can manage instances in this environment.
